the idea for the homepage is a pixel me sitting on top of
the intro card
the background is some cool gradient or a nice color
-> in dark mode
in light mode it can be nice and simple

we can have things floating around in a bubble that you pop when you click


OMG i have good idea:

basically imagine the theme is underwater. So my pixel guy now has a fishing helment
on (reference to runescape) and the colors and of texts and the fonts are changed
to reflect the theme.

the super fun part is you essentially will have a slideshow of the sites, 
but in the form of bubbles floating towards the top.
in the bubble is a link to different pages on the site or projects.

there needs to be a "no bs" button for a simple site style

^theme switcher great demo

the goal here is to create this without editing html. on theme with
csszengarden.



special event at the bottom where its like basically an easter egg
the easter egg has some kind of input (that you have to learn how to keep private)
and with that input if they get it correct it'll link to a secret page (that you
also keep hidden) that talks about runescape and maybe links your channel >.>
